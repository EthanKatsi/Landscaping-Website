I Designed and created a fully functioning website for my landscaping business I created during the summer of 2023 with HTML where I did landscaping for people around my neighbourhood for $16-$22 an hour. I started with a template from the software called "Nicepage" and edited the HTML code with Visual Studio Code from there.
I hope you enjoy this website I created, as this is the first fully functioning website i've made with HTML.
I did not code any of the js or css files, that was created by nicepage but I wrote the HTML code for this website.
